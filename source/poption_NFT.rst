Poption NFT (Draft)
===========================
As we introduced earlier, the derivative market has the potential to bring new value to DeFi. Poption has a suitable architecture with smart contracts but it is not a very traditional derivative. To make people learn more about poption, we are going to issue NFTs to motivate users to explore our products (with test tokens or true money). These NFTs will be minted when users complete certain tasks in poption. They can be traded on-chain. All owners and minters of the NFTs will be able to redeem 20% of the poption tokens in the future.

Poption NFT is a kind of Game-Fi, so have fun. A little difference is people can learn general derivative knowledge and ideas when they 'play' with poption.

Rules
-----------------------
1. After a user completes certain game tasks, he can mint NFT. The NFT will carry minting information and game task information. Including minter, create time, task name, task attributes, etc. All these information form the traits of the NFT.
2. After completing the minting, the minter shall give a price to the NFT. The price information will be stored in the smart contract.
3. An investor can buy the NFT and pay the price via transacting with the smart contract. The investor becomes the new owner of the NFT.
4. The new owner shall also give a price to the NFT and lock 1/10 of the price into the contract. The new owner can change the price at any time. The locked asset is released when another investor buys the NFT or the owner decreases the price.


Principals for Redeem
-------------------------------------
#. We will give a fair price for each NFT when redeeming poption tokens. The higher the fair price of an NFT, the more poption tokens it can redeem.
#. The fair price of an NFT is related to the market price of NFTs of similar traits, if the prices of similar NFTs are higher, their fair price is also higher.
#. The fair price of an NFT is related to its minter, and the more evidence a minter is human, the higher the fair price of the NFT.
#. The fair price of an NFT is related to its creation time. The less NFTs are minted in a time period (e.g. a week), the higher the fair price of the NFTs. This generally equates to the earlier the NFT is minted, the higher its fair price.
#. The owners who are also the minter of the NFT shall lock the 1/10 of the fair price for a period of time (e.ge. 2 weeks) before the redeeming.
#. The fair price calculating algorithm and codes shall be open-sourced and viewed by the community a month before the redeeming.
#. All NFT tokens can redeem 20% of all poption tokens. If the system works well, the fraction may increase to 30%.
#. The NFT owners will take 70% of all value and the minter will take the rest 30% in redeeming.

NFT as An Airdrop
----------------------------------
Poption NFT is a kind of airdrop, and it has some advantages over traditional airdrops.

#. It delays the decision-making of who can get the airdrop and make it easier than before. In poption NFT, everyone can mint NFTs. NFTs minted in different ways will be identified by different traits. Unlike traditional airdrop, if some kinds of tokens are too easy to mint, they will be worthless in the NFT market, and their fair price will be very low and will take little share in the redeeming. On the other hand, the minters and owners who really give true value will be able to redeem more poption tokens. Airdrop becomes much easier because of the price information given by the NFT market.
#. The NFT market also increases the transparency of the airdrop. Before redeeming the poption token, the poption NFT market should be run on-chain for a long time and everyone can access the data if they are interested in it.
#. The investors can be naturally introduced. If investors are interested in the project, they can buy the NFT directly.

Holding Cost and Its Meaning
----------------------------------
In NFT, market abuse behavior like wash trading is a big problem. We hope the poption NFTs will represent the long term value of the poption community. We need a trustful market price to show the value and calculate the fair price, so we introduce holding cost with the lock asset mechanism. With this mechanism, it is costly to keep a very high price for a lot of NFTs for a long time. Besides, the discount of the locked asset will act like property tax. Then the price in this market would be much meaningful than in other current NFT market. It would be a good mechanism in a bear market.

Plan
----------------
Plan to finish the contract writing and some other software development this month (Jun 2022). Open the activity next month (July 2022). Welcome any discussion and suggestions about the plan. (You will be able to mint NTFs because of your contribution. So just do it.)
