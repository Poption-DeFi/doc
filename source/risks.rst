Risks
===============

The contracts are **NOT** audited and there may be vulnerabilities exploited by hackers. We opened all our `contract source codes <https://github.com/Poption-DeFi>`_ and there is no ‘onlyowner’ in the `Poption contract <https://github.com/Poption-DeFi/poption-contract/blob/master/contracts/Poption.sol>`_ . The contracts are also verified in Etherscan.
**Do your own research** about the code.

#. Derivative itself is very risky. If the prediction to the market is right, the investor win more, and if it is wrong the investor lose more and maybe all of his investment. But this also means high capital efficiency.
#. The liquidity pool level is very low now, so the slippage is high. But it is still O.K. to play with a little money or add liquidity.
#. To add liquidity is always more risky than only to swap.
