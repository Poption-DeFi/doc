"Poption is a general purpose derivative designed for blockchain. It is "
"fully based on smart contracts. No centralized part or para chain is "
"needed. It requires one price oracle and one asset to work. Please notice"
" that only one but not two asset is required to work. This makes it "
"possible to manage the risk from the asset outside the chain and this "
"will create value in the chain."

"In this cold crypto winter, let's consider the future of the ecosystem. "
"The ecosystem needs to create more value to grow up. Algorithm stable "

"Prediction markets (also known as betting markets, information markets, "

"people can trade contracts that pay based on the outcomes of unknown "
"future events. The market prices generated from these contracts can be "
"understood as a kind of collective prediction among market participants. "
"If the future event is based on the price of some assets, then these "
"contracts can be viewed as some derivatives, and the prediction market "
"becomes derivative market. The advantages and disadvantages of such a "
"derivative market are listed as following."

"In legacy finance, the premium of an option is calculated based on the "
"expectation of the payoff, which is :math:`\\int _0 ^\\infty p(x) f(x) "
"dx` , where :math:`f(x)` is the payoff of the option and :math:`p(x)` is "
"the probability density function of the price at the expired date. This "
"is exactly the same way a prediction market works. In a prediction "
"market, a ticket is priced as the probability of its event. When a market"
" participant holds some tickets whose payoff is :math:`f(i)` where "
":math:`i` represents the event whose probability is :math:`p(i)`, then "
"the cost of these tickets should be :math:`\\sum_i p(i) f(i)`. With some "
"math trikes, it is possible to convert a prediction market to a "
"derivative market on the chain. Acturally, we have already created one, "
"and we call it poption. However only some smart contracts are not enough "
"to achieve our goal. We need an ecosystem, we need liquidity providers, "
"speculators, arbitragers, and hedgers to make an efficient market and "
"bring values to the crypto eco."

"Suppose we have created a prediction market that predicts the prices of "
"some assets in the future and speculators are using this market to make "
"money. Usually, a prediction market is a zero-sum game, however, a worked"
" prediction market can give accurate predictions of the events. And a "
"hedger who wants to buy some insurance to shift the risk of the price "
"change can use the prediction to price the risk. Now the speculators play"
" the role of actuary and the prediction market becomes a derivative "
"market that makes value. And this is a non-zero-sum game now.  We can "
"also create value from the opposite flow. While speculators are "
"speculating derivatives on-chain, arbitrageurs can take advantage of the "
"spreads between on-chain and off-chain to arbitrage. This arbitrage will "
"carry the transaction from speculators on-chain to the off-chain market, "
"thus enhancing the market accessibility."
