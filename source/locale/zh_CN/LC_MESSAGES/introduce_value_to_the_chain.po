"In this cold crypto winter, let's consider the future of the ecosystem. "
"The ecosystem needs to create more value to grow up. Algorithm stable "
"coin can not create value from void. How about others? Someone says NTF, "
"someone says metaverse. Yes, they have potential, but I believe that "
"finance is still the most potential area because of its high demand for "
"trust that can be provided by blockchains at a low cost."

"The value we are going to bring to the ecosystem is the value of "

"with high capital efficiency. For example, we can hedge against the "

"In prediction market theory, automated market makers buy information from"
" the speculators, and this causes the loss of the liquidity providers. In"
" spot markets like Uniswap, the loss is in the form of impermanent loss. "
"In a derivative market, the loss will be permanent because of the "
"expiration and be higher because of the higher capital efficiency. To "
"avoid the loss, the liquidity provider shall tune the parameters in the "
"market maker contract to give more information to avoid loss from the "
"speculators. Imagine that there are several automated market makers in a "
"derivative market. The market makers who can provide the lowest fee and "
"earn the most profit will survive in the market. Tuning the market maker "
"is highly based on the accurate prediction to the market which is very "
"skillful and can bring value to the tuner. The tuner will act like a "
"hedge fund manager and the automated market maker will be some kind of a "
"hedge fund. The bigger the market is, the better manager it can attract, "
"and the higher value they create."
