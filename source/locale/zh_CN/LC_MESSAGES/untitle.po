msgid "Liquidity Providing from Farming to Speculating"

"When the first time I provide liquidity to a swap pair. I feel I am "
"farming. But soon I realized I am speculating. I guess some people have "
"the same experience and feeling as me. Because of the impermanent loss, "
"providing liquidity is more speculating than farming. Then the next "
"question is how can we speculate it?"

"There is no AMM liquidity provider in traditional finance. Can we find a "
"concept in traditional market to help us understand liquidity providing "
"as a speculator. Earlier this year, I wrote a `tool "
"<https://www.poption.exchange/tools/il>`_  to help people calculate the "
"impermanent loss in v3 or v2 Uniswap pool. The impermanent loss looks "
"like this."

"If we want to hedge the loss, we should buy something that gives us more "
"value when the price goes much lower or higher, which is longing the "
"volatility. In other words, providing liquidity is to short the "
"volatility. When the price value of the pair does not change heavily, "
"liquidity providers earn more fees than the loss; otherwise, liquidity "
"providers lose more than the earning fee."

"We call the period that the liquidity is not in the pool escaping period."
" If the pool collects less fee than the impermanent loss in this period, "
"the strategy makes more money than simply continually providing "
"liquidity. The impermanent loss comes from selling more precious tokens "
"at a poorer price. By escaping the high volatility period, we do not sell"
" tokens at a poorer price, instead, we sell them at a fair price (though "
"suffering some fee)."

"Currently, some simple MACD style volatility indexes are enough to "

"Do some simple backtesting, it shows that even a simple strategy can "
"outperform the baseline with about 300 bp in a year. Notice that the "
"drawdown of the strategy is low for it is only the missed fee when the "
"liquidity is not in the pool. Although the result is not strong, it is a "
"significant improvement compared to leaving the asset in the liquidity "
"pool. It also shows that, we can speculate on providing liquidity."

"From whom the money comes? In this strategy, the money comes from the "
"arbitrager. They earn less from the liquidity provider. The pool becomes "
"more sensitive to price change and this helps the market to find out the "
"price quicker. The strategy also benefits the rest liquidity provider in "
"the pool because it may earn more fees now."

"I will release some services including backtesting to help people "

"helpful for people to make money from predicting volatility and sharing "
"the return with the original liquidity provider."
