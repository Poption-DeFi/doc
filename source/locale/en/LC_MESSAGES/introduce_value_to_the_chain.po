"Poption is a general purpose derivative designed for blockchain. It is "
"fully based on smart contracts. No centralized part or para chain is "
"needed. It requires one price oracle and one underlying asset to work. "
"Please notice that only one but not two underlying asset is required to "
"work. This makes it possible to manage the risk from the asset outside "
"the chain and this will create value in the chain."

"In this cold crypto winter, let's consider the future of the ecosystem. "
"The ecosystem needs to create more value to grow up. Algorithm stable "
"coin can not create value from void. How about others? Someone says NTF, "
"someone says metaverse. Yes, they have potential, but I believe that "
"finance is still the most potential area because of its high demand for "
"trust that can be provided by blockchains at a low cost."

"The value we are going to bring to the ecosystem is the value of "
"derivatives. Deveritives provides tools to manage the risk and speculate "
"with high capital efficiency. For example, we can hedge against the "
"fluctuation of foreign exchange rates via foreign exchange options, or "
"speculate an off-chain stock efficiently."

"Suppose we have created a prediction market that predicts the prices of "
"some assets in the future and speculators are using this market to make "
"money. Usually, a prediction market is a zero-sum game, however, a worked"
" prediction market can give accurate predictions of the events. And a "
"hedger who wants to buy some insurance to shift the risk of the price "
"change can use the prediction to price the risk. Now the speculators play"
" the role of actuary and the prediction market becomes a derivative "
"market that makes value. And this is a non-zero-sum game now.  We can "
"also create value from the opposite flow. While speculators are "
"speculating derivatives on-chain, arbitrageurs can take advantage of the "
"spreads between on-chain and off-chain to arbitrage. This arbitrage will "
"carry the transaction from speculators on-chain to the off-chain market, "
"thus enhancing the market accessibility."

"In legacy finance, the premium of an option is calculated based on the "
"expectation of the payoff, which is :math:`\\int _0 ^\\infty p(x) f(x) "
"dx` , where :math:`f(x)` is the payoff of the option and :math:`p(x)` is "
"the probability density function of the price at the expired date. This "
"is exactly the same way a prediction market works. In a prediction "
"market, a ticket is priced as the probability of its event. When a market"
" participant holds some tickets whose payoff is :math:`f(i)` where "
":math:`i` represents the event whose probability is :math:`p(i)`, then "
"the cost of these tickets should be :math:`\\sum_i p(i) f(i)`. With some "
"math trikes, it is possible to convert a prediction market to a "
"derivative market on the chain. Acturally, we have already created one, "
"and we call it poption. However only some smart contracts are not enough "
"to achieve our goal. We need an ecosystem, we need liquidity providers, "
"speculators, arbitragers, and hedgers to make an efficient market and "
"bring values to the crypto eco."
