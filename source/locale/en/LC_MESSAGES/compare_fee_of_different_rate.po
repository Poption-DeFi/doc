"Which pool should I pick when I add assets into a liquidity pool?  There "
"are too many choices. There are different fee rates, different chains, "
"and even different stablecoins, even after we made the decision on which "
"pair to add into. When the first time I added liquidity into the pool, I "
"made this decision almost blindly based on a hypothesis that the market "
"is efficient and others will test these different pools with their money."

"In the Uniswap v3 pool, the variables `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` and "
"`feeGrowthGlobal1X128` record the fee collected per unit of liquidity in "
"the pool. It only depends on the price change of the pair. So we can "
"calculate the fee easily with swap event data. I compare the fee "
"collected by WETH-(USDC/USDT/DAI) pair on Ethereum, they share the same "
"price and are the most important pools in Uniswap. Because of sharing the"
