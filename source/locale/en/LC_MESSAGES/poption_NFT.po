"As we introduced earlier, the derivative market has the potential to "
"bring new value to DeFi. Poption has a suitable architecture with smart "
"contracts but it is not a very traditional derivative. To make people "
"learn more about poption, we are going to issue NFTs to motivate users to"
" explore our products (with test tokens or true money). These NFTs will "
"be minted when users complete certain tasks in poption. They can be "

"in different ways will be identified by different traits. Unlike "
"traditional airdrop, if some kinds of tokens are too easy to mint, they "
"will be worthless in the NFT market, and their fair price will be very "
"low and will take little share in the redeeming. On the other hand, the "
"minters and owners who really give true value will be able to redeem more"

msgid ""
"In NFT, market abuse behavior like wash trading is a big problem. We hope"
" the poption NFTs will represent the long term value of the poption "
"community. We need a trustful market price to show the value and "
"calculate the fair price, so we introduce holding cost with the lock "
"asset mechanism. With this mechanism, it is costly to keep a very high "
"price for a lot of NFTs for a long time. Besides, the discount of the "
"locked asset will act like property tax. Then the price in this market "
"would be much meaningful than in other current NFT market. It would be a "
"good mechanism in a bear market."
