"About 3 months ago, I planned to encourage people to interact with "
"Poption and learn the ideas behind it. It can be done by airdrop. An "
"important function of airdrop is buying participation with tokens. Then "
"the question is which price? In a traditional airdrop, the team price the"
" airdrop, and this happens only once. However, This makes it difficult to"
" determine the price without rich knowledge of this market. Can we make "
"this easier? Then NFT as airdrop is invented. The NFT markets will help "
"the team solve the pricing problem. The team can buy back the NFT from "
"the market to encourage the participants. Nowadays, more and more teams "
"are using NFT as their airdrop methods, and so do we. Poption is "
"releasing **Poption contribution NFT** as our airdrop."

"There are different kinds of Poption contribution NFTs all in one ERC-721"
" contract. Participants who completed certain tasks can mint certain "
"kinds of NFT. Participants can sell the NFTs back to the Poption team and"
" get ERC-20 tokens, or they can sell them to other investors, or they can"
" keep the NFTs as collections. The Poption team will give the price of an"
" NFT based on the role of the creator and the task the NFT minted from. "
"If a white hat reports a bug and minted an NFT from the participation. "
"The NFT shall be valuable. If a robot mints a lot of NFTs from greetings."
" The NFTs are worthless. The team will be a reasonable market maker to "
"encourage the participants continuously."

"The idea of the mechanism is to introduce a carrying cost to the NFT "

"price of the staking token will also be a soft price connection between "
"all the NFT tokens in the same contract. When some NFT's price is "
"raising, more staking tokens are required, and the price of the tokens "
"will also be raised, which also influence the price of other NFT tokens."

"In Goerli, we have deployed a Poption contribution NFT contract for "
"testing. The staking tokens are test POP tokens. The token is designed to"
" be easily used in a testing environment. Without minting, every address "
"has 1 POP at the beginning. The scalar of the contribution NFT is 20, "
"which means the owners should lock 5% of the NFT value to keep their "
"NFTs. There are only a few kinds of contributions that can be minted now."
" We will continuously add new kinds of contributions to make it more fun."
