On-Chain Derivative Market Will Introduce New Value To the Crypto
=====================================================================
In this cold crypto winter, let's consider the future of the ecosystem. The ecosystem needs to create more value to grow up. Algorithm stable coin can not create value from void. How about others? Someone says NTF, someone says metaverse. Yes, they have potential, but I believe that finance is still the most potential area because of its high demand for trust that can be provided by blockchains at a low cost.

The value we are going to bring to the ecosystem is the value of derivatives. Derivatives provides tools to manage the risk and speculate with high capital efficiency. For example, we can hedge against the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates via foreign exchange options, or speculate an off-chain stock efficiently.

Information Processor as a Market
---------------------------------------
We can view the derivative market as an information processor. It collects and processes information and provides insurance based on this information. And in the opposite direction, we can make an information processor as a market. Since it would be simply an information processor, it is suitable to be hosted in cyberspace like a blockchain. In this information processing system, speculators are the information collectors, market makers are the processor, and hedgers and arbitragers are the consumers.

* **Speculators** Speculators creates valuable information. They collect information from all over the world and make a prediction based on their information. They submit their predictions by trading. They can get reward when they give right prediction to the market and make the price more accurate. They shall be punishend when they give poor prediction.

* **Liquidity providers** They provide liquidity to the market maker which aggregates the information. The liquidity also lubricates the system. They earn profit from transaction fees. They will also hold positions and take the risks of poor pricing.

* **hedgers** They are the consumer of the valuable information. They will buy derivatives to cover their risks elsewhere and pay value to the whole system.

* **arbitragers** They are also the consumer of valuable information. If the market gives good predictions, the arbitrager will carry the useful information to the off-chain market and bring the value back. However, the system will also lose value if the predictions are poor.


Prediction Market as a Derivative Market
---------------------------------------------------
Since a market can be viewed as an information processor, we can design it within the framework of information theory, or more specifically a prediction market.

Prediction markets (also known as betting markets, information markets, decision markets, idea futures or event derivatives) are markets where people can trade contracts that pay based on the outcomes of unknown future events. The market prices generated from these contracts can be understood as a kind of collective prediction among market participants. If the future event is based on the price of some assets, then these contracts can be viewed as some derivatives, and the prediction market becomes derivative market.

The advantages and disadvantages of such a derivative market are listed as following.

Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The market needs no underlying asset to work. An oracle that indroduce the information about the underlying asset and a kind of currency that be used as a pledge are enough to build such a market.
* It is not difficult to implement an automated market maker for such a market. The study of prediction markets is the cradle of automated market maker algorithms.
* The market can provide general-purpose products by designing proper prediction events.
* The prediction market and the European option have an isomorphic relationship, so we can migrate the pricing model of the European option to serve the prediction market. The premium of an European option is calculated based on the expectation of the payoff, and the expectation is based on the prediction of the event (the price of underlying asset on expired date), so dose a prediction market.
* Prediction market is highly capital efficient. What can be more capital efficient than betting?
* There is no short squeeze in a prediction market. The responsibility is limited by the pledge.

Disadvantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The liquidity providers hold positions and take high risk passively, especially for black swan events. But for risk neutral investors, this should be ok.
* People are not familiar with such a new design and it take time to understand the market. But everything is new in blockchain, isn't it?
* For such a new design, there must be some other unknown disadvantages.

Automated Market Maker as a Hedge Fund
---------------------------------------------
In prediction market theory, automated market makers buy information from the speculators, and this causes the loss of the liquidity providers. In spot markets like Uniswap, the loss is in the form of impermanent loss. In a derivative market, the loss will be permanent because of the expiration and be higher because of the higher capital efficiency. To avoid the loss, the liquidity provider shall tune the parameters in the market maker contract to give more information to avoid loss from the speculators. Imagine that there are several automated market makers in a derivative market. The market makers who can provide the lowest fee and earn the most profit will survive in the market. Tuning the market maker is highly based on the accurate prediction to the market which is very skillful and can bring value to the tuner. The tuner will act like a hedge fund manager and the automated market maker will be some kind of a hedge fund. The bigger the market is, the better manager it can attract, and the higher value they create.

Derivative Market as a Service
-----------------------------------
There are many occasions requiring derivatives to shift risk in the world, however, not all of them can find a derivative market to meet the needs. The blockchain approach can provide a solution with a low start cost. With the help of factory contracts, people can create different derivatives and market makers in a very convenient way. The derivative market on the blockchain will finally bring pricing power to every country. Make the international finance market more equal, the world more united, and the earth more flat.
